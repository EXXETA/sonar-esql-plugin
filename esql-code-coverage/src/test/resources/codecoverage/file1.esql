			There are two parts to finding the queue destination.
			The first is to get a table of all possible queues from the database and
			the second is to search this in memory table for the queue required

			To speed the processing, the first action will only be done when the first message enters the
			message flow. The retrieved database table will be stored in memory for any other messages
			to use. The cache can also be refreshed by putting a message onto the CACHE.MEMORY.REFRESH queue.
			
			It is important to note that all this processing is surrounded by a begin atomic block.
			This makes sure that only one message accesses the cache at a time. This is very important
			because the cache could be refreshed at any point. If two messages are using the cache at the
			same time then one could refresh the cache while the other one is using it.
			If refreshing is not going to be used or only used when the message flow has been stopped then the 
			BEGIN ATOMIC statement END; can be moved to just before the start of part 2. This is to make sure
			that the initialization of the cache is single threaded. The ATOMIC block is given a label called 
			"ROUTING". It is important to label ATOMIC blocks because all ATOMIC blocks with in a message flow, 
			with the same label, share the same lock even if they are in different compute nodes.

			Part 1: Getting the database table into memory.
			The database is only read if the CacheQueues.vaild field is set to null.
			This happens either at initialization time when the flow is
			ran for the first time or when the refresh part of the flow resets
			the cache.
			
			The actual select statement has several important constructs:
			1, CacheQueues.DestinationData[]
			   This is the shared variable that will store the contents of the 
			   routing database.
			
			2, select S.queue_manager as queueManager, S.queue_name as queueName
			   This part maps the column names in the table to the names that are required for routing.
			   
			3, from Database.routing_table as S 
			   This chooses the table to do the select from and sets up the variable S.
			   If the variable S is not defined then all column names have to be prefixed 
			   with Database.routing_table rather than S.
