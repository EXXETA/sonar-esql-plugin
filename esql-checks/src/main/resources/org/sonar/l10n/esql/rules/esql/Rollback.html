<p>Avoid using the ROLLBACK statement in ESQL code, as it can undermine the transaction
    handling mechanism of the message flow. Instead, consider using the THROW statement to
    raise an exception and trigger a rollback of the entire message flow. This approach helps
    ensure that the transaction handling mechanism operates correctly and reliably, without
    risking unexpected behavior or data loss.</p>
