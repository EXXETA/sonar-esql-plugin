<p>Avoid using the COMMIT statement in ESQL code, as it can undermine the transaction
    handling mechanism of the message flow.  Instead, consider restructuring the flow
    to handle smaller transactions or committing all changes at once. This approach
    helps ensure that the transaction handling mechanism operates correctly and reliably,
    without risking unexpected behavior or data loss. By avoiding the use of COMMIT statements,
    you can help maintain the integrity and consistency of the message flow's data.</p>
